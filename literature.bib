Two classes of reactor are considered: first, self-sustaining systems in which the charged reaction products are trapped and, secondly, pulsed systems in which all the reaction products escape so that energy must be supplied continuously during the pulse. It is found that not only must the temperature be sufficiently high, but also the reaction must be sustained long enough for a definite fraction of the fuel to be burnt.}

abstract = {Both microscopic and macroscopic impacts of the electromagnetic effects on blob dynamics are considered. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear BOUT++ simulations demonstrate that electromagnetic effects in high temperature or high beta plasmas suppress the resistive drift wave turbulence in the blob when resistivity drops below a certain value. In the course of blob’s motion in the SOL its temperature is reduced, which leads to enhancement of resistive effects, so the blob can switch from electromagnetic to electrostatic regime, where resistive drift wave turbulence become important. It is found that inhomogeneity of magnetic curvature or plasma pressure along the filament length leads to bending of the high-beta blob filaments. This is caused by the increase of the propagation time of plasma current (Alfvén time) in higher-density plasma. The effects of sheath boundary conditions on the part of the blob away from the boundary are also diminished by the increased Alfvén time.}

GBS is a three-dimensional, flux-driven, global, two-fluid turbulence code developed for the self-consistent simulation of plasma turbulence and kinetic neutral dynamics in the tokamak boundary. In the new version presented here, the simulation domain is extended to encompass the whole plasma volume, avoiding an artificial boundary with the core, hence retaining the core-edge-SOL interplay. A toroidal coordinate system is introduced to increase the code flexibility, allowing for the simulation of arbitrary magnetic configurations (e.g. single-null, double-null and snowflake configurations), which can also be the result of the equilibrium reconstruction of an experimental discharge. The implementation of a new iterative solver for the Poisson and Ampère equations is presented, leading to a remarkable speed-up of the code with respect to the use of direct solvers, therefore allowing for efficient electromagnetic simulations that avoid the use of the Boussinesq approximation. The self-consistent kinetic neutral model, initially developed for limited configurations, is ported to the magnetic configurations considered by the present version of GBS and carefully optimized. A new MPI parallelisation is implemented to evolve the plasma and neutral models in parallel, thus improving the code scalability. The numerical implementation of the plasma and neutral models is verified by means of the method of manufactured solutions. As an example of the simulation capabilities of the new version of GBS, a simulation of a TCV tokamak discharge is presented.},

Based on drift-reduced Braginskii equations, TOKAM3X is able to simulate both limited and diverted plasmas. Turbulence is flux driven by incoming particles from the core plasma and no scale separation between the equilibrium and the fluctuations is assumed so that interactions between large scale flows and turbulence are consistently treated. Based on a domain decomposition, specific numerical schemes are proposed using conservative finite-differences associated to a semi-implicit time advancement. The process computation is multi-threaded and based on MPI and OpenMP libraries. In this paper, fluid model equations are presented together with the proposed numerical methods. The code is verified using the manufactured solution technique and validated through documented simple experiments. Finally, first simulations of edge plasma turbulence in X-point geometry are also introduced in a JET geometry.},

	abstract = {The new European HPC facility for Fusion is in operation since July 2016. It replaces, for European fusion researchers, the Helios supercomputer installed in Japan in the context of the Broader Approach agreement. The supercomputer is hosted at CINECA and it is a fraction of the MARCONI system. Thanks to a customized technical project done by ENEA, in a joint development agreement with CINECA, the European community of fusion modeling can exploit the latest available CPU technologies, following the CINECA HPC roadmap towards 50 PFlops planned for 2019. The MARCONI Fusion fraction is being delivered in two phases: the first one, 1 PFlops of CPU multi-core architecture based on the Intel Broadwell processors, is already in operation since July 2016, and the second one, 5 PFlops of the same architecture based on the INTEL Skylake processors, will be deployed in July 2017. Furthermore, the project includes 1 PFlops of the third generation of Intel Xeon Phi many-core architecture (Knights Landing generation). Within this framework, ENEA/CINECA provides, in addition, the operation support of the Gateway infrastructure of EUROFusion Work-Package Code Development. A new Gateway HPC system is in operation at CINECA since Jan. 2017 thanks to the data migration and software porting activities carried out by ENEA/CINECA team together with the Core Programming Team of the Infrastructure and Support Activity work package from EUROfusion. The new Gateway infrastructure is tightly coupled with the MARCONI Fusion fraction, sharing the same 100 Gbps low-latency network based on the Intel OmniPath technology. The paper describes the technical details and the performances of MARCONI, one of the largest HPC OmniPath based infrastructure.},

	title = {Development and assessment of 2D fluid neutral models that include atomic databases and a microscopic reflection model},
	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Neutral particles play a crucial role in the plasma edge due to their strong interaction with the plasma. To capture all physics details most often a kinetic equation is solved using a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. Unfortunately, the MC noise hampers the convergence assessment of the solution of the coupled plasma-neutral equations. Moreover, the MC calculation time increases for high-collisional detached cases. In these high-collisional cases, however, the kinetic model may be well-approximated by a fluid neutral model, which can be solved deterministically. In this paper, we assess different fluid neutral models by comparing the resulting plasma sources to the sources from an MC simulation of the kinetic equation. The fluid models take into account the microscopic cross-sections and rate coefficients from the AMJUEL-HYDHEL databases, as well as the microscopic TRIM reflection model. We accomplish the latter without the introduction of any user-defined fitting parameters. We show that a pure pressure-diffusion equation provides accurate results for the particle source, but is inaccurate for the parallel momentum and ion energy source. Adding a parallel momentum equation gives maximum errors of about 9\% for the momentum and 32\% for the energy source. These errors are further reduced to respectively 6\% and 14\% by adding a separate neutral energy equation.}

	abstract = {Abstract Experimental results from several tokamaks suggest a strong impact of divertor density regimes on turbulent transport in the edge plasma. Reciprocally, the change in transverse transport and SOL width affects the access to density regimes, making it a fundamental topic for heat exhaust issue. Such phenomenology is highly nonlinear and can only be approached quantitatively using numerical simulations treating turbulence and neutrals recycling physics self-consistently. In this study, the SOLEDGE3X edge multi-fluid code is used to investigate the mutual interaction between edge plasma turbulence and neutrals recycling. A fluid neutrals model based on the assumption of a charge-exchange-dominated plasma-neutral interaction has been implemented. Two simulations in circular geometry are compared: one without neutrals, where the particle flux is driven by a constant in flux from the core region, and the other one with neutrals recycling included in which the particle input to the system is self-consistently injected by a gas puff from the midplane. The presence of the neutrals triggers three types of perturbations on the plasma: a local and non-axisymmetric one driven by the gas puff, a global perturbation affecting both profiles and turbulence properties in the whole domain, and a local one in the vicinity of the limiter where recycling occurs. The largest effect of the inclusion of self-consistent neutrals recycling is a large-scale reorganization of the plasma profiles and turbulence properties due to the dissociation of particle and energy fluxes. These effects are expected to be more important at higher densities regimes or in diverted configuration.}

	abstract = {WEST is an MA class superconducting, actively cooled, full tungsten (W) tokamak, designed to operate in long pulses up to 1000 s. In support of ITER operation and DEMO conceptual activities, key missions of WEST are: (i) qualification of high heat flux plasma-facing components in integrating both technological and physics aspects in relevant heat and particle exhaust conditions, particularly for the tungsten monoblocks foreseen in ITER divertor; (ii) integrated steady-state operation at high confinement, with a focus on power exhaust issues. During the phase 1 of operation (2017–2020), a set of actively cooled ITER-grade plasma facing unit prototypes was integrated into the inertially cooled W coated startup lower divertor. Up to 8.8 MW of RF power has been coupled to the plasma and divertor heat flux of up to 6 MW m−2 were reached. Long pulse operation was started, using the upper actively cooled divertor, with a discharge of about 1 min achieved. This paper gives an overview of the results achieved in phase 1. Perspectives for phase 2, operating with the full capability of the device with the complete ITER-grade actively cooled lower divertor, are also described.}

	title = {Scaling laws of density fluctuations at high-k on Tore Supra},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Anomalous transport in tokamaks is generally attributed to turbulent fluctuations. Since a large variety of modes are potentially unstable, a wide range of short-scale fluctuations should be measured, with wavenumbers from kρi ∼ 0.1 to kρi ≫ 1. In the Tore Supra tokamak, a light scattering experiment has made possible fluctuation measurements in the medium- and high-k domains where a transition in the k-spectrum is observed: the fluctuation level decreases much faster than usual observations, typically with a power law S(k) ≡ k−6. A scan of the ion Larmor radius shows that the transition wavenumber scales with ρi around kρi ∼ 1.5. This transition indicates that a characteristic length scale should be involved to describe the fluctuation nonlinear dynamics in this range. The resulting very low level of fluctuations at high-k does not support a strong effect of turbulence driven by the electron temperature gradient. For this gyroradius scan, the characteristics of turbulence also exhibit a good matching with predictions from gyro-Bohm scaling: the typical scale length of turbulence scales with the ion Larmor radius, the typical timescales with a/cs; the turbulence level also scales with ρi, according to the mixing length rule.}

	abstract = {With ITER, the largest tokamak ever built, and the growing number of fusion energy startups in the world, the need for numerical simulations has never been more crucial to progress towards the successful operation of fusion reactors. From fundamental plasma physics to engineering, a hierarchy of models exists from high-fidelity (gyro-)kinetic models in (5D) 6D to 0D fluid transport models. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of 3D turbulence fluid simulations in edge tokamak configurations. The widely used drift-reduced Braginskii equations are introduced together with the dedicated boundary conditions modelling plasma wall interactions. If until recently most of the models were focused on electrostatic turbulence driven by interchange-like instabilities, in recent years models have incorporated electromagnetic effects allowing fluctuations of the magnetic field. Specific features of the edge plasma configurations, which make these equations specially challenging to resolve and stressful for the numerical methods, are detailed. In particular, the strong anisotropy of the flow as well as the complex geometric characteristics lead to the development of dedicated discretization schemes and meshing, which are implemented in state-of-the-art codes reviewed here. It appears that the latter can be differentiated by their mesh construction as well by the manner in which they handle parallel gradients (aligned or not along the magnetic field). The review shows that no consensus on the optimal combination between meshing and discretization schemes, if it exists, has been found. Finally, examples of recent achievements show that 3D turbulence simulations of medium-sized tokamaks are currently achievable, but that ITER-size tokamaks and thermonuclear plasmas still require significant progress.}

	abstract = {{The SOL width is a parameter of paramount importance in modern tokamaks as it controls the power density deposited at the divertor plates, critical for plasma-facing material survivability. An understanding of the parameters controlling it has consequently long been sought [Connor et al. Nucl. Fusion 39(2), 169 (1999)]. Prior to Chang et al. [Nucl. Fusion 57(11), 116023 (2017)], studies of the tokamak edge have been mostly confined to reduced fluid models and simplified geometries, leaving out important pieces of physics. Here, we analyze the results of a DIII-D simulation performed with the full-f gyrokinetic code XGC1 which includes both turbulence and neoclassical effects in realistic divertor geometry. More specifically, we calculate the particle and heat E × B fluxes along the separatrix, discriminating between equilibrium and turbulent contributions. We find that the density SOL width is impacted almost exclusively by the turbulent electron flux. In this simulation, the level of edge turbulence is regulated by a mechanism that we are only beginning to understand: ∇B-drifts and ion X-point losses at the top and bottom of the machine, along with ion banana orbits at the low field side, result in a complex poloidal potential structure at the separatrix which is the cause of the E × B drift pattern that we observe. Turbulence is being suppressed by the shear flows that this potential generates. At the same time, turbulence, along with increased edge collisionality and electron inertia, can influence the shape of the potential structure by making the electrons non-adiabatic. Moreover, being the only means through which the electrons can lose confinement, it needs to be in a balance with the original direct ion orbit losses to maintain charge neutrality.}},

	abstract = {A new modular code called BOUT++ is presented, which simulates 3D fluid equations in curvilinear coordinates. Although aimed at simulating Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) in tokamak x-point geometry, the code is able to simulate a wide range of fluid models (magnetised and unmagnetised) involving an arbitrary number of scalar and vector fields, in a wide range of geometries. Time evolution is fully implicit, and 3rd-order WENO schemes are implemented. Benchmarks are presented for linear and non-linear problems (the Orszag–Tang vortex) showing good agreement. Performance of the code is tested by scaling with problem size and processor number, showing efficient scaling to thousands of processors. Linear initial-value simulations of ELMs using reduced ideal MHD are presented, and the results compared to the ELITE linear MHD eigenvalue code. The resulting mode-structures and growth-rate are found to be in good agreement (γBOUT++=0.245ωA, γELITE=0.239ωA, with Alfvénic timescale 1/ωA=R/VA). To our knowledge, this is the first time dissipationless, initial-value simulations of ELMs have been successfully demonstrated.}

Results for test examples show independence of the numerical error from χ∥ for values of χ∥/χ⊥ up to 109 in plane and 1012 in periodic cylinder geometry (simulating toroidal connection).

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Self-consistent full-size turbulent-transport simulations of the divertor and scrape-off-layer (SOL) of existing tokamaks have recently become feasible. This enables the direct comparison of turbulence simulations against experimental measurements. In this work, we perform a series of diverted ohmic L-mode discharges on the tokamak à configuration variable (TCV) tokamak, building a first-of-a-kind dataset for the validation of edge turbulence models. This dataset, referred to as TCV-X21, contains measurements from five diagnostic systems from the outboard midplane (OMP) to the divertor targets—giving a total of 45 one- and two-dimensional comparison observables in two toroidal magnetic field directions. The experimental dataset is used to validate three flux-driven 3D fluid-turbulence models—GBS, GRILLIX and TOKAM3X. With each model, we perform simulations of the TCV-X21 scenario, individually tuning the particle and power source rates to achieve a reasonable match of the upstream separatrix value of density and electron temperature. We find that the simulations match the experimental profiles for most observables at the OMP—both in terms of profile shape and absolute magnitude—while a comparatively poorer agreement is found towards the divertor targets. The match between simulation and experiment is seen to be sensitive to the value of the resistivity, the heat conductivities, the power injection rate and the choice of sheath boundary conditions. Additionally, despite targeting a sheath-limited regime, the discrepancy between simulations and experiment also suggests that the neutral dynamics should be included. The results of this validation show that turbulence models are able to perform simulations of existing devices and achieve reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. Where disagreement is found, the validation helps to identify how the models can be improved. By publicly releasing the experimental dataset and validation analysis, this work should help to guide and accelerate the development of predictive turbulence simulations of the edge and SOL.}
