\addchap{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my thesis director Eric Serre and supervisor Hugo Bufferand for their support throughout my PhD thesis. A big shoutout goes to the entire SOLEDGE3X team, and in particular to Patrick Tamain, for their fruitful discussions, continuous feedback and help with the code framework. I also thank Aix Marseille University, CEA and EUROfusion for permitting this thesis at all and the CINES and CINECA super-computing infrastructures to run simulations.
